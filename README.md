## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.\*. To install these libraries you will need to execute:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using data from Prosper Marketplace Inc. is a San Francisco to understand:

1. which income range people tend to apply for a loan more?
2. what is the distribution of the employment status and what is the average income of each status?
3. What variables that have an impact on whether the borrowers will complete their loans?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There an `analysis.ipynb` notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@hashem.sf/how-ready-are-you-for-your-next-loan-88464bc5c0d6).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Prosper Marketplace for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shikhar07/loan-data-from-prosper). Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
